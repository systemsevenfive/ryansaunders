            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                When I was a kid, I wanted to build my own website. Angelfire’s visual editor couldn’t do what I wanted, so I clicked the “Advanced Editor” button and stared at raw HTML 
                for the first time. A little trial and error later, I had a my very own website dedicated to predictions about the next Star Wars movie.
            </p>
            <p>
                My great-uncle was a graphic designer, and he gave me my first Mac. I experimented with HTML in SimpleText and tested pages in Netscape Navigator. A middle-school computer 
                class introduced me to HyperCard, and while I wasn’t quite ready to build the next Myst, I pushed my machine as far as I could. In high school it was all about Flash and Actionscript. 
                I won’t admit how much logic I crammed into a single “God object,” but that was probably my first lesson in software architecture.
            </p>
            <p>
                My career-long relationship with the Apple ecosystem grew naturally from those early days. I played my first games on a Mac, maintained the iMac lab in high school, worked with Macs in 
                broadcast TV, and even built my first VR experiments on a Mac with the original Oculus DK1. I’m not an Apple evangelist, but my life and work have consistently intersected with their 
                platform—and I’ve leaned into it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fast-forward to 2025: I’ve spent the last seven years as a full-time iOS developer. Adult life leaves less time for the kind of tinkering I grew up with, but I still build small apps, 
                try new ideas, and occasionally ship something to the App Store. If you're interested in seeing some examples, please check out the links below.
